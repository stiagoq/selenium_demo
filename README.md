## Introduction
This project contains automation tests with the Selenium framework using the Java programming language.

The test cases in this project are profile creation, login and shopping cart on a demo e-commerce page.

## Requirements
- Development environment: This project was created in MacOS operating system
-	Programming language: This project was created using Java programming language. 
-	Required tools: 
    - JDK 8 or superior
    - Maven 
-	Required dependencies:
    - Selenium WebDriver
    - Cucumber
	- TestNG

## Setup
-	Clone this repository in your local machine
-	You can open the automation project in integrated development environment (IDE), for instance; IntelliJ IDEA, VScode, Eclipse, etc.
-	Instructions to install the required dependencies:
	```bash
    mvn install 
    ```

## Running Test
You can run the test of following way:
-	Run all tests
	```bash 
    mvn verify test
    ```
-	Run specific tests with parameters (runner, browser, and environment):
	```bash 
	mvn verify -Dtest=runnername -Denvironment=environment -Dbrowser=browser
	```
-	Run test in IDE
    - By default the test is run with chromedriver and qa environment found in the config.properties file

## Web Browser
The automation tests of this project currently run on the following web browsers
-	Chrome:  Google Chrome [Version 131](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/)
-	Firefox: [geckodriver-V0.35.0](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

## Project structure 
This project mainly uses the designed POM pattern but here the user actions (methods) are separated from the web elements in different classes.  Also, the project uses Cucumber and Gherkin integrated with Selenium WebDriver to create test cases. In general, the project consists of feature written in Gherkin language, step definitions in this file defines methods belonging to scenario and runner in which test cases execution is configured.
